# nailsWeb
this is a website made for Adriana Garcia Barios' nail business. It was made by Emmy Regal and Megan Farran 😎🔥🤩

it should be used to schedule appointments and to view her past work as a nail tech 
we're using the C# dev and the blazor app to make the website 

2/4/25 today we just setup the github repo and made some minor changes to figure out what everything does and what is already built in
