# nailsWeb
this is a website made for Adriana Garcia Barios' nail business. It was made by Emmy Regal and Megan Farran ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥ðŸ¤©

it should be used to schedule appointments and to view her past work as a nail tech 
we're using the C# dev and the blazor app to make the website 

2/4/25 today we just setup the github repo and made some minor changes to figure out what everything does and what is already built in 

1. figure out structure set up (what functionality do we need?)
2. layout 
    top vs side bar 
    how many tabs 
        pics
        calendar
        book now 
        contact 
        home 
3. aesthetic 
4. buttons to book (and adrianas schedule) (google calendar?)
5. nulling out void times (cant book twice)
6. user silmunateously? 
7. user sign in accounts (more work) or just phone numbers/names
8. make own calendar (break up the months into chunks) (update months in advance first of every month)
9. 

ping adriana so her address doesnt get leaked
